    // Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8,
    // this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
    // Now write another method fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.
    //This can be done in just a couple of lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).
